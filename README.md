In a town haunted by ghosts and under the imminent threat of the malevolent Ghost King, you, the protagonist, have just ten minutes to thwart their spectral conquest. The Ghost King challenges the town's original residents, promising their salvation if someone can defeat him in one-on-one combat. To stand a chance, you must acquire the ultimate weapon, a powerful artifact capable of banishing the spectral threat.

This extraordinary weapon isn't given freely but can be obtained by accumulating points strategically. Points can be earned through various means, including participating in skill-testing minigames for valuable coins, scavenging coins scattered throughout the town, and bravely confronting and defeating ghostly soldiers in key locations.

Alternatively, you can gather specific items scattered across the spectral landscape to craft the ultimate weapon. The essence of this challenging quest lies in the interplay between acquiring points, strategically collecting resources, and facing spectral adversaries. As the minutes tick away, urgency builds, compelling you to navigate the haunted town with skill and strategy, ensuring the defeat of the Ghost King and the preservation of the town's sanctity.
