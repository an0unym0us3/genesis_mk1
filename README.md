whats up??

Welcome to the next generation of webscrapers!
Usually when we buy someting we usually look for a few things
1. Price
2. Legibility

Our project is about to revolutionize the latter; Legibility.

We usually rate the legibility of the seller by either reading reviews of them on youtube and other websites, hearing from friends, how sketchy the website page is (too many adds or hidden popup buttons) and so many things.

This projects aims to automate or make it easier for users to have a better view of what they are getting into, by using Artificial intelligence, some clever algorithms, and of course the good old manual user reviews, to give mroe perspectives to the user, and that they could decide for themselves.
