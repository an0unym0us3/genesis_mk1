supposedly the town is haunted with ghosts and theyre gonna take over the town in the next 10 minutes, you as the protagonist should stop this from happening by... scoring points??

Apparently the ghost king challenged the original town people to get their town back; If someone can win him on a one to one fight he and his goons will flee the town for good.
You can do so by getting the ultimate weapon. This weapon can be bought (idea: crafted by getting certain items) by the points that you have accumulated, by playing minigames that give coins, finding coins scattered throughout the map, and kiling ghost soldiers, etc idk what else someone send help
